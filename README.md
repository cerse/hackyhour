# Edinburgh RSE HackyHour

## About

Come to talk about code, tools and research in a social environment. Get help from others to take forward your work. Find new collaborators, projects or ideas. Or just enjoy a change of scene.

## When and Where

We're experimenting with Friday from 2-3pm in the cafe in the Bayes Centre. Dates where people have said they'll be there are listed below.

## Inspiration
